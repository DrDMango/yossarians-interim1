            "summary": "It's something like a trend now: people say often, 'If Donald Trump didn't exist, someone else would be him. He is a product of this time' or 'If Hitler didn't exist, World War Two would happen anyway. He was a product of his time and&hellip;",
            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    It's something like a trend now: people say often, 'If Donald Trump didn't exist, someone else would be him. He is a product of this time' or 'If Hitler didn't exist, World War Two would happen anyway. He was a product of his time and the weakened post-war German economy'. This is a highly significant change from how history used to be taught and believed to be: Great Men and their effects on the world. But is this way of thinking about history really a new development? As always, no.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The Great Man theory was made popular in the 19th century by Thomas Carlyle, and it posits that history is driven by extraordinary leaders or heroes whose actions drive a populace into an action. This way of thinking implies that without George Washington there would have been no American Revolution, without Hitler there would have been no Holocaust, and without Genghis Khan there would have been no Mongolian Empire. This is in contrast to Social History, which gained popularity in the mid-20th century. This way of thinking shifts focus from extraordinary leaders to the people they lead, and examined the peoples' values and who they chose to lead. The Social Historian would say that Hitler did not drive the Holocaust, but Hitler was an idol of the people's feelings of anti-semitism, resentment, and debts. The Social Historian that Hitler could not move the people of Germany to a Holocaust today because he does not represent the values of the Germans of today. Great Man History emphasizes individualism and Social History emphasizes collectivism.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    These two views are certainly opposite, but they are not incompatible. One may say in many instances that the Great Leader would be the breaking point or the straw that breaks the camel's back ... that is to mean that the values of the people could simmer forever, and without a Great Leader to exploit that and draw it out, those values would slowly dissipate. An example of this could be the inter-war Indian (or perhaps generally Colonial) desire for independence. The Indians saw their people sent to World War One and hoped to see something come of it, but nothing ever did: they had no strong leader to rally them into fighting. Whether you chalk this lack of a strong leader up to British assassination of leaders or general poverty, the fact is: there was no leader, and there was no real revolution. But when Gandhi took power, he was a true leader, and he led the independence movement as an idol of the Indian's peoples feelings and spoke about them, and he brought India independence. Another instance of this simmering but unused feeling could be American slaves' resentment against their masters. Again, there were some disputes and small revolutions, but nothing very unified and nothing <i>very </i>effective, for they had no leader.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This does not work if a small group has very large feelings ... this would not work for Anarcho-Capitalists, the Communists, or the Nazis; because the average person does not harbor any of these sentiments, but the members of these groups feel very strongly about these things. A Great Leader can only change society if the broader society feels a certain simmering feeling that could be exploited. If there is no Great Leader, nothing shall happen. A modern example of a simmering feeling with no Great Leader for it is the rapidly growing anti-immigration sentiment in the West, or male loneliness epidemic ostensibly chalked up to feminism by involuntary celibates, though these problems have been finding Great Leaders in Donald J. Trump or Alice Weidel.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To conclude, Great Man history means that Great Leaders drive up feelings in a population and drive a population to an action. Social History means that a population feels something and themselves commit to an action. However, one must combine these two: there is a simmering feeling in a general populace that must be recognized and exploited by a Great Leader in order to achieve anything truly.\n  </p>",

Note the scaffolding deconstructing the tenements.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    From Wikipedia: \"42 Lomasney Way is a tenement brownstone located in Boston's West End. Built in the 1870s, the building has been called The Last Tenement, as it is the only building that was not demolished during the West End's redevelopment phase or subsequent construction periods.\" The residents of the structure began recieving eviction letters in 1958 and soon the demolition began.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    There is ample historical reasoning as to why its neighbors have been demolished: the freeway was an attractive piece of infrastructure for any American city from 1940-1980, and highly desirable, and the Housing Act of 1949 made it desirable for cities to redevelop their slums into highways or social housing projects. People needed to get to the city from the suburbs, and the suburbs were not dense enough for trains; and so the highway was necessary. Poor areas like these with many Jews, Asians, and Irish were often first on the list to be demolished to make way.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    But why was this structure not demolished? There was nothing very remarkable about the building that would warrant its protection, and usually, tracks of dense urban fabric during the 1950s were deemed to be blighted and demolished all at once. See: Pruitt-Igoe.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    One explanation is classic: the residents of the buildings refused to move out and would not vacate their structure, and so the developers had no choice but allow them to stay. One is generous: perhaps the city wanted to give a landmark of how the West End used to be, and how it could become once more. Another is more dazzling: perhaps the building was owned by the mob for a while, and with mob and city connections they were able to make the sale not happen.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/101-TWITTER2.png\" height=\"3125\" width=\"2500\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-xs.png 640w ,https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-sm.png 768w ,https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-md.png 1024w ,https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-lg.png 1366w ,https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-xl.png 1600w ,https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>The Boston West End before and after Urban Renewal.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    These are all plausible explanations, but we will probably never be able to explain this away.\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Many Black Americans of the 1900s were quite aware of Africa, especially Liberia, the country to which some formerly enslaved Black Americans departed in the 19th Century to become Americo-Liberians. They were aware of the situation there because the Black newspapers of the day covered often some news from that country. But that didn't mean American Negroes were eager to relocate. It was a common discourse from White segregationist politicians that Black people would be happier in Africa -- ex., Alabama Senator John T. Morgan claimed there were more opportunities for Black people in Africa, and he also stated, without evidence, that \"millions\" of Black people wanted to move back (\"Wants Afro-Americans,\" 1907). In reality, however, this idea did not get much traction in the 1890s nor 1910s, and only very limited traction in the early 1920s.<br><br>Periodically, there would be a newspaper article citing a white scholar praising Liberia and encouraging American Blacks to make the move: for example, Dr. Frederick Starr of the University of Chicago, asserted that Liberia was \"the only expression of self-government in Africa...[and] the only hope of the continent\" (\"Nations Will,\" 1919). And sometimes, Black activists too would sometimes visit Africa, but according to the Black press, these visits often led to disappointment and a renewed desire to come back home to America (\"Afro-American,\" 1911). In other words, American Negroes, while interested in what was happening in Liberia, remained determined to improve the situation for Black people in the United States, rather than moving anywhere (\"Alfred C. Sam,\" 1914). Black readers of the Chicago Defender, Baltimore Afro-American, Pittsburgh Courier, and others, were also well aware that many countries in Africa had been colonized by white Europeans, and thus, these countries did not seem to offer American Negroes any greater opportunities than they already had. The Defender frequently editorialized that the majority of Black Americans had no memory of Africa, and therefore, it was foolish to present that continent as some sort of utopia (\"Back to Africa,\" 1921).<br><br>That said, by the late 1910s, Marcus Garvey, a Black man who was born in Jamaica, and the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), was leading a Back to Africa Movement in New York, where he had settled around 1917. A controversial but charismatic speaker, Garvey believed that Black people would never be treated fairly in America, and he advocated creating a future in Liberia. His lectures about Black pride, and his promise of a better life in Africa attracted considerable attention, and circa 1922, his UNIA organization claimed a membership of more than 2 million people; however some scholars believe that claim was exaggerated (Kallen, 2006). Further, little evidence suggests that neither Garvey nor any other Black nationalists were successful in persuading large numbers of Black people to leave the United States. So, as I noted earlier, while many American Black people kept up with the major events in Liberia and other African countries, the vast majority of the community was focused on ending segregation and improving the quality of life for Black people in the USA.<br><br>\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Just as the ideas of World War Two had blitzed London and eliminated Warsaw, the ideas after World War Two decimated the American city. Great cities of historical architecture on a human scale were demolished in crazy sweeps for so-called slum clearance or urban renewal, eliminating Kansas City, St. Louis, Detroit.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    However, a unique case was present in that neighborhood of New York, the South Bronx. This area was a primarily Jewish and German neighborhood until around the fifties, where the max exodus of White people from the city to the suburb really began to pick up. Following this, that area was populated with Black Americans and Puerto Ricans, who filled in the area. The South Bronx went from being two-thirds non-Hispanic white in 1950 to being two-thirds black or Puerto Rican in 1960. Then, the seventies and eighties came, and made the South Bronx famous then and today in terms of crime, poverty, and general morale.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Here, I will discuss what the causes of the South Bronx's burning was.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Firstly, many New York City bills either accidentally or purposefully (due to racism or the fact that it was easier to run highways through poor regions than taxpayers' areas) assisted with this flattening of the South Bronx. One of the most popular in this regard was the Housing Act of 1949, which aimed to address housing shortages and urban blight by allocating money for slum clearance, creating spaces for urban housing projects like Pruitt-Igoe, the famous now-demolished icon of modern architecture. This allowed federal interference in tight-knit communities, demolishing them and running highways through them, as Robert Moses famously did.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A project of Robert Moses' that segregated the Black and Puerto Rican South Bronx from the still pretty White (Jewish) North Bronx of 1955 was the Cross-Bronx Expressway, paid for by the aforementioned Housing Act of 1949. It destroyed a significant amount of homes, and split neighborhoods; displacing ~60,000.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Another large factor to this mass burning of the Bronx that should not be understated is rent control. Great post-war rent control acts were passed across the city of New York, such as the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law of 1946. Where these laws perhaps made some sense in the context of the great American post-war boom, they were highly anachronistic later on, and directly led to the landlords of the South Bronx torching their apartments using gangsters, sometimes with people inside.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The reason that those landlords torched those apartments is because they could not rent them out legally at market price. 1970-80 South Bronx apartments were frozen at Depression-era prices. Under normal circumstances, the natural economies of the marketplace would have resolved the issue, and there would be no such issues today. Where housing was in short supply (ex. the UES of Manhattan), rising prices would have encouraged residents to move to places like Harlem or the South Bronx where housing was cheap, and landlords would be encouraged to improve the quality of their structures, given that they would be able to charge higher prices to the new, richer gentrifiers.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    However, the brutal rent control laws wrecked that system like the Industrial Revolution on the working habitats of Manhattan Island. Because landlords in the fashionable, rich districts like South of Houston were unable to raise their rents, the residents of that area did not have to move away, and landlords in poor areas like Harlem or the South Bronx had no reason to improve their structures: they could not charge more if they did, so there was no incentive to repair their buildings. And it's not like the tenants of those townhomes had anywhere to go, after all: the suburbs were segregated if not <i>de facto </i>then <i>de jure</i>, no real new housing was being built; and in some instances, large swathes of brick and old American architecture were being entirely demolished in Urban Renewal. This created a positive feedback loop, in which lower-class areas became ever-more lower-class, and upper-class areas became ever-more fashionable and prestigious.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The results of decrease of profit for landlords led to them abandoning their businesses and maintaining them: there was simply no incentive to. Another government doing, tax foreclosure, encouraged landlords to sometimes divest entirely of their property and half services and repairs completely. Losing ever more money, especially in places like the South Bronx where they were losing an extreme amount of money, many landlords hired arsonists to burn down their properties so they can collect the insurance from them. This method worked, and more landlords paid more arsonists to burn buildings, sometimes with people with-in the apartments. Due to the atrocious quality of the buildings, fires could easily hop from building to building, eliminating lots at a time, and creating surprise fires for residents in the night.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The fire department, try as they did, could do hardly anything. Their funding had been cut from the city, given that the city of New York was nearly going to go bankrupt, and they were cutting as much as they could to pay it back. This led to an underfunded South Bronx or Harlem fire department. Of course, areas that paid for themselves like South of Houston stayed healthy with a good fire department. Where there was demand, though, where swathes of buildings were being destroyed at a time, there were simply not enough firefighters, too little resources, and too many fires. Seven different census tracts of the Bronx reported losing up to 97% of their buildings, and many more lost more.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    One may say that the landlords were acting immorally. To that I say, yes, they were. But they were acting realistic, and if landlords will act like this, the government must not pass bills and laws that may do such a thing. Were there no such regulations, such a gutting of the Bronx would have never happened.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The total cost of the catastrophe was 10 million dollars for New York taxpayers, for nothing. This was an extreme example of what a problem occurring in many of our cities today could lead to, and shows the adverse effects of government in the economy.\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Everything that we consider as modern liberal values after WWII, was caused by the post-war seeing of Hitler as the absolute pure evil, and that everything he does the modern West must do the opposite. We may see this in the revolutionary post-war values of the post-war United States of America in literature, art, and character. What were these post-war values? What were their ideas?\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The modern liberal values are directly the opposite of whatever Hitler and the Nazis stood for. World War Two had easy values and easy figureheads which were mythologized, and the idea of WWII as a myth was exacerbated especially by the Television and the new literature of the era. WWII penetrates our society today. and its values to a degree which is not present for any other war or revolution -- perhaps the American Revolution to some extent helps guide American culture, but WWII is the great uniter of culture at least across the West. The mythologization drove WWII into Good (us) vs. Bad (them), a concept which is pretty crazy historically. Hitler and the Nazis were obviously bad, and what would become the hippies heard this from their parents and from the media all the time. With their newfound individualism and all the attention on them, they decided that if Hitler was bad, then they would stand for whatever Hitler wasn't.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Yes, just the opposite of whatever Hitler believed in. Where Hitler pushed for nationalism and patriotism, the post-war literature of the day was pretty anti-patriotic, and firmly anti-nationalist. Where Hitler wanted to be a strong imperialist and colonial power like the rest of the West, the loud percentage of baby boomers wanted to end an unjust colonial occupation of foreign lands. Hitler came out of Germany, one of the premier instances of the Western culture then, and if Western culture and Western values could produce something so destructive and horrible, then something must be terribly wrong with Western culture, especially White Western that the Native Americans, Indians, or African-Americans did not feel. And so grew the International Style of Architecture (this was a philosophical idea much before the 1960s, but it really only took off so to speak in the 1960s), 'Modern Art', Existentialism and Postmodernism and more. White kids created a new sort of religion of not-Hitler, which is how such individualism and sexual liberty and freedom and anti-Christian and anti-Western values kept going on and on, adapting with characters and ideas from&nbsp;Bhaktivedanta Swami and such.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This revolutionary idea is echoing even now. Remnants of Hitlerian values are still being eliminated by left-leaning groups, especially ones in the revolutionary Youth Culture, which only became a thing in the 1950s. One can see this in the Christian religion, which has been picked on since the 1950s as something for the parents, something old, and something that limits. It is seen as something that is fake. While Christianity stayed incredibly popular up until the 1970s, it has died down in droves, cutting about 10% every decade. One can see how anti-Christian sentiment was en vogue among teens looking to irritate their parents, something that was not true pre-War, wherein there was no Youth Culture. There was Eminem and Marilyn Manson and the Satanic Panic and all this, and now Christianity is about 60% of the population. The same thing happens with conformity. Modern liberal values want to do away completely with the stuffy old conformity of the 1950s with suits and ties. They show more skin, and such, and as this continues, you have people who keep trying to subvert the population by doing something ever-stranger and ever-more unbelievable, and eventually you get to a situation that you saw in the last Grammys. Kim Kardashian went to the Grammys basically nude. This was incredibly subversive, and just about one of the last things she (or her producers or husband) could do to be popular and irritate the pearl-clutching Christians of America.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    ...\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This being the case, that World War Two switched the values of Western Civilization so much and it is still going on today, then what would happen after World War Three? What would the values look like?\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Well, the first important thing is to determine the values of each side, and to determine the values of each side, we must determine the alliances of each side. This is honestly pretty arbitrary, because it will probably be the individualist West versus the pretty conformist East (though that is changing with the spreading of the Nuclear family across the world, creating Individualism there. But for the sake of argument, I should like to say that it would be the Individualist versus the Conformist).\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    If the West wins this war, there would be hardly any change to society except perhaps a slight change in demographics with refugees, and perhaps a neo-Marshall plan of some sort. Nevertheless, the anti-Hitler values had won the war, and the society may continue as normal. But what if the Conformist East won the War?\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Where Hitler pushed for nationalism and patriotism, the post-war literature of the day was pretty anti-patriotic, and firmly anti-nationalist. Where Hitler wanted to be a strong imperialist and colonial power like the rest of the West, the loud percentage of baby boomers wanted to end an unjust colonial occupation of foreign lands.

White kids created a new sort of religion of not-Hitler, which is how such individualism and sexual liberty and freedom and anti-Christian and anti-Western values kept going on and on, adapting with characters and ideas from Swami Bhaktivedanta and such.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Then, I believe, you would have a societal change on the scale of the hippies in Western Europe, America, Oceania, but instead of having the values we do now, we would see the values shifting closer towards to pre-WWII values. I'll call this class of conservative revolutionaries 'yuppies', to be funny. I believe that where the hippies pushed for anti-patriotism and skepticism, the yuppies be jingoistic and nationalistic. Where the hippies wanted de-colonization (that is, no more obvious colonization ... we still see the white man's burden in, for example, USAID and financial influence in the CFA Franc) perhaps the yuppies would want a re-colonization?! perhaps extreme, but .... Where the modern Western values of individualism fell short, perhaps they need to be remedied by collectivism and conformity. The yuppies would look at the ugly, cut up cities of highways and brutalist and steel architecture and seek to replace it with a Western architecture, a walkable city. This is what the yuppies would do.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Of course, we don't need a war to bring about this social change. The right (not the far-right, mind you ... what an overused term) has obviously been gaining power in Germany with their AfD, America with Donald Trump, and much more. New Urbanism, which is really conservative as it seeks to bring back long-standing traditions of building, is beginning to take hold, especially in France, Poland, and some areas of America (it is popular among the youth). But of course, we will never know what will happen until we do.\n  </p>",
