Note the scaffolding deconstructing the tenements.</figcaption></figure><p>From Wikipedia: "42 Lomasney Way is a tenement brownstone located in Boston's West End. Built in the 1870s, the building has been called The Last Tenement, as it is the only building that was not demolished during the West End's redevelopment phase or subsequent construction periods." The residents of the structure began recieving eviction letters in 1958 and soon the demolition began.</p><p>There is ample historical reasoning as to why its neighbors have been demolished: the freeway was an attractive piece of infrastructure for any American city from 1940-1980, and highly desirable, and the Housing Act of 1949 made it desirable for cities to redevelop their slums into highways or social housing projects. People needed to get to the city from the suburbs, and the suburbs were not dense enough for trains; and so the highway was necessary. Poor areas like these with many Jews, Asians, and Irish were often first on the list to be demolished to make way.</p><p>But why was this structure not demolished? There was nothing very remarkable about the building that would warrant its protection, and usually, tracks of dense urban fabric during the 1950s were deemed to be blighted and demolished all at once. See: Pruitt-Igoe.&nbsp;</p><p>One explanation is classic: the residents of the buildings refused to move out and would not vacate their structure, and so the developers had no choice but allow them to stay. One is generous: perhaps the city wanted to give a landmark of how the West End used to be, and how it could become once more. Another is more dazzling: perhaps the building was owned by the mob for a while, and with mob and city connections they were able to make the sale not happen.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/101-TWITTER2.png" height="3125" width="2500" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-xs.png 640w, https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-sm.png 768w, https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-md.png 1024w, https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-lg.png 1366w, https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-xl.png 1600w, https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/media/posts/14/responsive/101-TWITTER2-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>The Boston West End before and after Urban Renewal.</figcaption></figure><p>These are all plausible explanations, but we will probably never be able to explain this away.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/authors/dhruv-ravindra/" rel="author">Dhruv Ravindra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/african-americans-feelings-about-africa.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> African-American&#x27;s Feelings About Africa</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/great-man-vs-social-history.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Combining the Great Man and Social History Theories</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
