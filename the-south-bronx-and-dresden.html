Great cities of historical architecture on a human scale were demolished in crazy sweeps for so-called slum clearance or urban renewal, eliminating Kansas City, St. Louis, Detroit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, a unique case was present in that neighborhood of New York, the South Bronx. This area was a primarily Jewish and German neighborhood until around the fifties, where the max exodus of White people from the city to the suburb really began to pick up. Following this, that area was populated with Black Americans and Puerto Ricans, who filled in the area. The South Bronx went from being two-thirds non-Hispanic white in 1950 to being two-thirds black or Puerto Rican in 1960. Then, the seventies and eighties came, and made the South Bronx famous then and today in terms of crime, poverty, and general morale.</p><p>Here, I will discuss what the causes of the South Bronx's burning was.</p><p>Firstly, many New York City bills either accidentally or purposefully (due to racism or the fact that it was easier to run highways through poor regions than taxpayers' areas) assisted with this flattening of the South Bronx. One of the most popular in this regard was the Housing Act of 1949, which aimed to address housing shortages and urban blight by allocating money for slum clearance, creating spaces for urban housing projects like Pruitt-Igoe, the famous now-demolished icon of modern architecture. This allowed federal interference in tight-knit communities, demolishing them and running highways through them, as Robert Moses famously did.&nbsp;</p><p>A project of Robert Moses' that segregated the Black and Puerto Rican South Bronx from the still pretty White (Jewish) North Bronx of 1955 was the Cross-Bronx Expressway, paid for by the aforementioned Housing Act of 1949. It destroyed a significant amount of homes, and split neighborhoods; displacing ~60,000.</p><p>Another large factor to this mass burning of the Bronx that should not be understated is rent control. Great post-war rent control acts were passed across the city of New York, such as the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law of 1946. Where these laws perhaps made some sense in the context of the great American post-war boom, they were highly anachronistic later on, and directly led to the landlords of the South Bronx torching their apartments using gangsters, sometimes with people inside.</p><p>The reason that those landlords torched those apartments is because they could not rent them out legally at market price. 1970-80 South Bronx apartments were frozen at Depression-era prices. Under normal circumstances, the natural economies of the marketplace would have resolved the issue, and there would be no such issues today. Where housing was in short supply (ex. the UES of Manhattan), rising prices would have encouraged residents to move to places like Harlem or the South Bronx where housing was cheap, and landlords would be encouraged to improve the quality of their structures, given that they would be able to charge higher prices to the new, richer gentrifiers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the brutal rent control laws wrecked that system like the Industrial Revolution on the working habitats of Manhattan Island. Because landlords in the fashionable, rich districts like South of Houston were unable to raise their rents, the residents of that area did not have to move away, and landlords in poor areas like Harlem or the South Bronx had no reason to improve their structures: they could not charge more if they did, so there was no incentive to repair their buildings. And it's not like the tenants of those townhomes had anywhere to go, after all: the suburbs were segregated if not <i>de facto </i>then <i>de jure</i>, no real new housing was being built; and in some instances, large swathes of brick and old American architecture were being entirely demolished in Urban Renewal. This created a positive feedback loop, in which lower-class areas became ever-more lower-class, and upper-class areas became ever-more fashionable and prestigious.&nbsp;</p><p>The results of decrease of profit for landlords led to them abandoning their businesses and maintaining them: there was simply no incentive to. Another government doing, tax foreclosure, encouraged landlords to sometimes divest entirely of their property and half services and repairs completely. Losing ever more money, especially in places like the South Bronx where they were losing an extreme amount of money, many landlords hired arsonists to burn down their properties so they can collect the insurance from them. This method worked, and more landlords paid more arsonists to burn buildings, sometimes with people with-in the apartments. Due to the atrocious quality of the buildings, fires could easily hop from building to building, eliminating lots at a time, and creating surprise fires for residents in the night.&nbsp;</p><p>The fire department, try as they did, could do hardly anything. Their funding had been cut from the city, given that the city of New York was nearly going to go bankrupt, and they were cutting as much as they could to pay it back. This led to an underfunded South Bronx or Harlem fire department. Of course, areas that paid for themselves like South of Houston stayed healthy with a good fire department. Where there was demand, though, where swathes of buildings were being destroyed at a time, there were simply not enough firefighters, too little resources, and too many fires. Seven different census tracts of the Bronx reported losing up to 97% of their buildings, and many more lost more.</p><p>One may say that the landlords were acting immorally. To that I say, yes, they were. But they were acting realistic, and if landlords will act like this, the government must not pass bills and laws that may do such a thing. Were there no such regulations, such a gutting of the Bronx would have never happened.</p><p>The total cost of the catastrophe was 10 million dollars for New York taxpayers, for nothing. This was an extreme example of what a problem occurring in many of our cities today could lead to, and shows the adverse effects of government in the economy.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/authors/dhruv-ravindra/" rel="author">Dhruv Ravindra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/why-is-this-boston-tenement-so-lonely.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Why is this Boston tenement so lonely?</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
