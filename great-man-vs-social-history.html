He is a product of this time' or 'If Hitler didn't exist, World War Two would happen anyway. He was a product of his time and the weakened post-war German economy'. This is a highly significant change from how history used to be taught and believed to be: Great Men and their effects on the world. But is this way of thinking about history really a new development? As always, no.</p><p>The Great Man theory was made popular in the 19th century by Thomas Carlyle, and it posits that history is driven by extraordinary leaders or heroes whose actions drive a populace into an action. This way of thinking implies that without George Washington there would have been no American Revolution, without Hitler there would have been no Holocaust, and without Genghis Khan there would have been no Mongolian Empire. This is in contrast to Social History, which gained popularity in the mid-20th century. This way of thinking shifts focus from extraordinary leaders to the people they lead, and examined the peoples' values and who they chose to lead. The Social Historian would say that Hitler did not drive the Holocaust, but Hitler was an idol of the people's feelings of anti-semitism, resentment, and debts. The Social Historian that Hitler could not move the people of Germany to a Holocaust today because he does not represent the values of the Germans of today. Great Man History emphasizes individualism and Social History emphasizes collectivism.</p><p>These two views are certainly opposite, but they are not incompatible. One may say in many instances that the Great Leader would be the breaking point or the straw that breaks the camel's back ... that is to mean that the values of the people could simmer forever, and without a Great Leader to exploit that and draw it out, those values would slowly dissipate. An example of this could be the inter-war Indian (or perhaps generally Colonial) desire for independence. The Indians saw their people sent to World War One and hoped to see something come of it, but nothing ever did: they had no strong leader to rally them into fighting. Whether you chalk this lack of a strong leader up to British assassination of leaders or general poverty, the fact is: there was no leader, and there was no real revolution. But when Gandhi took power, he was a true leader, and he led the independence movement as an idol of the Indian's peoples feelings and spoke about them, and he brought India independence. Another instance of this simmering but unused feeling could be American slaves' resentment against their masters. Again, there were some disputes and small revolutions, but nothing very unified and nothing <i>very </i>effective, for they had no leader.</p><p>This does not work if a small group has very large feelings ... this would not work for Anarcho-Capitalists, the Communists, or the Nazis; because the average person does not harbor any of these sentiments, but the members of these groups feel very strongly about these things. A Great Leader can only change society if the broader society feels a certain simmering feeling that could be exploited. If there is no Great Leader, nothing shall happen. A modern example of a simmering feeling with no Great Leader for it is the rapidly growing anti-immigration sentiment in the West, or male loneliness epidemic ostensibly chalked up to feminism by involuntary celibates, though these problems have been finding Great Leaders in Donald J. Trump or Alice Weidel.</p><p>To conclude, Great Man history means that Great Leaders drive up feelings in a population and drive a population to an action. Social History means that a population feels something and themselves commit to an action. However, one must combine these two: there is a simmering feeling in a general populace that must be recognized and exploited by a Great Leader in order to achieve anything truly.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/authors/dhruv-ravindra/" rel="author">Dhruv Ravindra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/why-is-this-boston-tenement-so-lonely.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Why is this Boston tenement so lonely?</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
