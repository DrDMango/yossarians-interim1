They were aware of the situation there because the Black newspapers of the day covered often some news from that country. But that didn't mean American Negroes were eager to relocate. It was a common discourse from White segregationist politicians that Black people would be happier in Africa -- ex., Alabama Senator John T. Morgan claimed there were more opportunities for Black people in Africa, and he also stated, without evidence, that "millions" of Black people wanted to move back ("Wants Afro-Americans," 1907). In reality, however, this idea did not get much traction in the 1890s nor 1910s, and only very limited traction in the early 1920s.<br><br>Periodically, there would be a newspaper article citing a white scholar praising Liberia and encouraging American Blacks to make the move: for example, Dr. Frederick Starr of the University of Chicago, asserted that Liberia was "the only expression of self-government in Africa...[and] the only hope of the continent" ("Nations Will," 1919). And sometimes, Black activists too would sometimes visit Africa, but according to the Black press, these visits often led to disappointment and a renewed desire to come back home to America ("Afro-American," 1911). In other words, American Negroes, while interested in what was happening in Liberia, remained determined to improve the situation for Black people in the United States, rather than moving anywhere ("Alfred C. Sam," 1914). Black readers of the Chicago Defender, Baltimore Afro-American, Pittsburgh Courier, and others, were also well aware that many countries in Africa had been colonized by white Europeans, and thus, these countries did not seem to offer American Negroes any greater opportunities than they already had. The Defender frequently editorialized that the majority of Black Americans had no memory of Africa, and therefore, it was foolish to present that continent as some sort of utopia ("Back to Africa," 1921).<br><br>That said, by the late 1910s, Marcus Garvey, a Black man who was born in Jamaica, and the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), was leading a Back to Africa Movement in New York, where he had settled around 1917. A controversial but charismatic speaker, Garvey believed that Black people would never be treated fairly in America, and he advocated creating a future in Liberia. His lectures about Black pride, and his promise of a better life in Africa attracted considerable attention, and circa 1922, his UNIA organization claimed a membership of more than 2 million people; however some scholars believe that claim was exaggerated (Kallen, 2006). Further, little evidence suggests that neither Garvey nor any other Black nationalists were successful in persuading large numbers of Black people to leave the United States. So, as I noted earlier, while many American Black people kept up with the major events in Liberia and other African countries, the vast majority of the community was focused on ending segregation and improving the quality of life for Black people in the USA.<br><br></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/authors/dhruv-ravindra/" rel="author">Dhruv Ravindra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/the-south-bronx-and-dresden.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The South Bronx and Regulation</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/why-is-this-boston-tenement-so-lonely.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Why is this Boston tenement so lonely?</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
