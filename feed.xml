  <p>
    It's something like a trend now: people say often, 'If Donald Trump didn't exist, someone else would be him. He is a product of this time' or 'If Hitler didn't exist, World War Two would happen anyway. He was a product of his time and the weakened post-war German economy'. This is a highly significant change from how history used to be taught and believed to be: Great Men and their effects on the world. But is this way of thinking about history really a new development? As always, no.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Great Man theory was made popular in the 19th century by Thomas Carlyle, and it posits that history is driven by extraordinary leaders or heroes whose actions drive a populace into an action. This way of thinking implies that without George Washington there would have been no American Revolution, without Hitler there would have been no Holocaust, and without Genghis Khan there would have been no Mongolian Empire. This is in contrast to Social History, which gained popularity in the mid-20th century. This way of thinking shifts focus from extraordinary leaders to the people they lead, and examined the peoples' values and who they chose to lead. The Social Historian would say that Hitler did not drive the Holocaust, but Hitler was an idol of the people's feelings of anti-semitism, resentment, and debts. The Social Historian that Hitler could not move the people of Germany to a Holocaust today because he does not represent the values of the Germans of today. Great Man History emphasizes individualism and Social History emphasizes collectivism.
  </p>

  <p>
    These two views are certainly opposite, but they are not incompatible. One may say in many instances that the Great Leader would be the breaking point or the straw that breaks the camel's back ... that is to mean that the values of the people could simmer forever, and without a Great Leader to exploit that and draw it out, those values would slowly dissipate. An example of this could be the inter-war Indian (or perhaps generally Colonial) desire for independence. The Indians saw their people sent to World War One and hoped to see something come of it, but nothing ever did: they had no strong leader to rally them into fighting. Whether you chalk this lack of a strong leader up to British assassination of leaders or general poverty, the fact is: there was no leader, and there was no real revolution. But when Gandhi took power, he was a true leader, and he led the independence movement as an idol of the Indian's peoples feelings and spoke about them, and he brought India independence. Another instance of this simmering but unused feeling could be American slaves' resentment against their masters. Again, there were some disputes and small revolutions, but nothing very unified and nothing <i>very </i>effective, for they had no leader.
  </p>

  <p>
    This does not work if a small group has very large feelings ... this would not work for Anarcho-Capitalists, the Communists, or the Nazis; because the average person does not harbor any of these sentiments, but the members of these groups feel very strongly about these things. A Great Leader can only change society if the broader society feels a certain simmering feeling that could be exploited. If there is no Great Leader, nothing shall happen. A modern example of a simmering feeling with no Great Leader for it is the rapidly growing anti-immigration sentiment in the West, or male loneliness epidemic ostensibly chalked up to feminism by involuntary celibates, though these problems have been finding Great Leaders in Donald J. Trump or Alice Weidel.
  </p>

  <p>
    To conclude, Great Man history means that Great Leaders drive up feelings in a population and drive a population to an action. Social History means that a population feels something and themselves commit to an action. However, one must combine these two: there is a simmering feeling in a general populace that must be recognized and exploited by a Great Leader in order to achieve anything truly.

  <p>
    From Wikipedia: "42 Lomasney Way is a tenement brownstone located in Boston's West End. Built in the 1870s, the building has been called The Last Tenement, as it is the only building that was not demolished during the West End's redevelopment phase or subsequent construction periods." The residents of the structure began recieving eviction letters in 1958 and soon the demolition began.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is ample historical reasoning as to why its neighbors have been demolished: the freeway was an attractive piece of infrastructure for any American city from 1940-1980, and highly desirable, and the Housing Act of 1949 made it desirable for cities to redevelop their slums into highways or social housing projects. People needed to get to the city from the suburbs, and the suburbs were not dense enough for trains; and so the highway was necessary. Poor areas like these with many Jews, Asians, and Irish were often first on the list to be demolished to make way.
  </p>

  <p>
    But why was this structure not demolished? There was nothing very remarkable about the building that would warrant its protection, and usually, tracks of dense urban fabric during the 1950s were deemed to be blighted and demolished all at once. See: Pruitt-Igoe.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    One explanation is classic: the residents of the buildings refused to move out and would not vacate their structure, and so the developers had no choice but allow them to stay. One is generous: perhaps the city wanted to give a landmark of how the West End used to be, and how it could become once more. Another is more dazzling: perhaps the building was owned by the mob for a while, and with mob and city connections they were able to make the sale not happen.

  <p>
    Just as the ideas of World War Two had blitzed London and eliminated Warsaw, the ideas after World War Two decimated the American city. Great cities of historical architecture on a human scale were demolished in crazy sweeps for so-called slum clearance or urban renewal, eliminating Kansas City, St. Louis, Detroit.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    However, a unique case was present in that neighborhood of New York, the South Bronx. This area was a primarily Jewish and German neighborhood until around the fifties, where the max exodus of White people from the city to the suburb really began to pick up. Following this, that area was populated with Black Americans and Puerto Ricans, who filled in the area. The South Bronx went from being two-thirds non-Hispanic white in 1950 to being two-thirds black or Puerto Rican in 1960. Then, the seventies and eighties came, and made the South Bronx famous then and today in terms of crime, poverty, and general morale.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here, I will discuss what the causes of the South Bronx's burning was.
  </p>

  <p>
    Firstly, many New York City bills either accidentally or purposefully (due to racism or the fact that it was easier to run highways through poor regions than taxpayers' areas) assisted with this flattening of the South Bronx. One of the most popular in this regard was the Housing Act of 1949, which aimed to address housing shortages and urban blight by allocating money for slum clearance, creating spaces for urban housing projects like Pruitt-Igoe, the famous now-demolished icon of modern architecture. This allowed federal interference in tight-knit communities, demolishing them and running highways through them, as Robert Moses famously did.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    A project of Robert Moses' that segregated the Black and Puerto Rican South Bronx from the still pretty White (Jewish) North Bronx of 1955 was the Cross-Bronx Expressway, paid for by the aforementioned Housing Act of 1949. It destroyed a significant amount of homes, and split neighborhoods; displacing ~60,000.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another large factor to this mass burning of the Bronx that should not be understated is rent control. Great post-war rent control acts were passed across the city of New York, such as the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law of 1946. Where these laws perhaps made some sense in the context of the great American post-war boom, they were highly anachronistic later on, and directly led to the landlords of the South Bronx torching their apartments using gangsters, sometimes with people inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reason that those landlords torched those apartments is because they could not rent them out legally at market price. 1970-80 South Bronx apartments were frozen at Depression-era prices. Under normal circumstances, the natural economies of the marketplace would have resolved the issue, and there would be no such issues today. Where housing was in short supply (ex. the UES of Manhattan), rising prices would have encouraged residents to move to places like Harlem or the South Bronx where housing was cheap, and landlords would be encouraged to improve the quality of their structures, given that they would be able to charge higher prices to the new, richer gentrifiers.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the brutal rent control laws wrecked that system like the Industrial Revolution on the working habitats of Manhattan Island. Because landlords in the fashionable, rich districts like South of Houston were unable to raise their rents, the residents of that area did not have to move away, and landlords in poor areas like Harlem or the South Bronx had no reason to improve their structures: they could not charge more if they did, so there was no incentive to repair their buildings. And it's not like the tenants of those townhomes had anywhere to go, after all: the suburbs were segregated if not <i>de facto </i>then <i>de jure</i>, no real new housing was being built; and in some instances, large swathes of brick and old American architecture were being entirely demolished in Urban Renewal. This created a positive feedback loop, in which lower-class areas became ever-more lower-class, and upper-class areas became ever-more fashionable and prestigious.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    The results of decrease of profit for landlords led to them abandoning their businesses and maintaining them: there was simply no incentive to. Another government doing, tax foreclosure, encouraged landlords to sometimes divest entirely of their property and half services and repairs completely. Losing ever more money, especially in places like the South Bronx where they were losing an extreme amount of money, many landlords hired arsonists to burn down their properties so they can collect the insurance from them. This method worked, and more landlords paid more arsonists to burn buildings, sometimes with people with-in the apartments. Due to the atrocious quality of the buildings, fires could easily hop from building to building, eliminating lots at a time, and creating surprise fires for residents in the night.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    The fire department, try as they did, could do hardly anything. Their funding had been cut from the city, given that the city of New York was nearly going to go bankrupt, and they were cutting as much as they could to pay it back. This led to an underfunded South Bronx or Harlem fire department. Of course, areas that paid for themselves like South of Houston stayed healthy with a good fire department. Where there was demand, though, where swathes of buildings were being destroyed at a time, there were simply not enough firefighters, too little resources, and too many fires. Seven different census tracts of the Bronx reported losing up to 97% of their buildings, and many more lost more.
  </p>

  <p>
    One may say that the landlords were acting immorally. To that I say, yes, they were. But they were acting realistic, and if landlords will act like this, the government must not pass bills and laws that may do such a thing. Were there no such regulations, such a gutting of the Bronx would have never happened.
  </p>

  <p>
    The total cost of the catastrophe was 10 million dollars for New York taxpayers, for nothing. This was an extreme example of what a problem occurring in many of our cities today could lead to, and shows the adverse effects of government in the economy.
