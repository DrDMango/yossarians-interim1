  <p>
    This is one of my favorite images, and raises quite a few questions. Why, in America, was something like this tolerated? How is something so ornate and obviously something so well-loved and lived in falling to pieces like this?<br><br>Well, for many reasons. First, in 1960-1980 the poor areas of New York were hellish because of lazy landlords who did not up-keep their buildings allowing them to fall into disrepair.<br><br>The Housing Act of 1949 allowed the Government to condemn large swathes of cities across America and take them over, allowing developers to demolish them and build, leading to projects like 'Stuytown', Cabrini-Green, or the infamous Pruitt-Igoe. The Act was also used to run freeways through those areas, leading to instances such as the Cross-Bronx Expressway, which was key in segregating New York further. Residents were told to evacuate, and black neighborhoods were destroyed. This was looked at as a good thing by rich whites, who thought 'what a good thing we are doing for the poor people! We are rescuing them from the slums! (they were not slums)'.<br><br>Due to this landlord abandonment and Housing Act, old buildings like this from the 1800s fell into swift disrepair, creating a truly awful situation. A special example is the South Bronx. Search for 'South Bronx 1970' on your favorite search engine.<br><br>... One of the reasons this is one of my favorite images are the details and the history of the thing, that are now gone. There is the large, garish 'Kennedy Fried Chicken', which sounds very close to 'Kentucky Fried Chicken'. From its design, we can see this building was used until its end. A metal plate covers brick at the bottom. Some windows are covered, some aren't. It is uneven. The plates between the windows on the fourth floor, or second from the top, are asymmetrical. There are old ads scrawled across the thing: 'Century Pawnbrokers' at the top, 'Loans and Amount' on the second and fourth columns. There is a broken up sign advertising Dry Cleaning, a new service. Haha. There's an 'X' next to that sign, showing it being condemned. Its sign used to have electric lights. The cornice is broken. There are plants growing off of it. There used to be square pediments on the windows, probably all broken off -- you can tell by the cleaner portions that are left. The building used to have neighbors, since demolished. (You can tell by its friend to the side, the taller buildings in the back, the size of this building, and the way tall buildings like these were put up in the late 19th century New York -- all at once.) The trees at the back are pretty, but one feels they may take over the place it is such a wreck. The tenement is ornate and beautiful, it has been loved, and it is now going to die. I really, really like this image.

  <p>
    From Wikipedia: "42 Lomasney Way is a tenement brownstone located in Boston's West End. Built in the 1870s, the building has been called The Last Tenement, as it is the only building that was not demolished during the West End's redevelopment phase or subsequent construction periods." The residents of the structure began recieving eviction letters in 1958 and soon the demolition began.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is ample historical reasoning as to why its neighbors have been demolished: the freeway was an attractive piece of infrastructure for any American city from 1940-1980, and highly desirable, and the Housing Act of 1949 made it desirable for cities to redevelop their slums into highways or social housing projects. People needed to get to the city from the suburbs, and the suburbs were not dense enough for trains; and so the highway was necessary. Poor areas like these with many Jews, Asians, and Irish were often first on the list to be demolished to make way.
  </p>

  <p>
    But why was this structure not demolished? There was nothing very remarkable about the building that would warrant its protection, and usually, tracks of dense urban fabric during the 1950s were deemed to be blighted and demolished all at once. See: Pruitt-Igoe.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    One explanation is classic: the residents of the buildings refused to move out and would not vacate their structure, and so the developers had no choice but allow them to stay. One is generous: perhaps the city wanted to give a landmark of how the West End used to be, and how it could become once more. Another is more dazzling: perhaps the building was owned by the mob for a while, and with mob and city connections they were able to make the sale not happen.

    These are all plausible explanations, but we will probably never be able to explain this away.
