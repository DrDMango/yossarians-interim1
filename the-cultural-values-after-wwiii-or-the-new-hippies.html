We may see this in the revolutionary post-war values of the post-war United States of America in literature, art, and character. What were these post-war values? What were their ideas?</p><p>The modern liberal values are directly the opposite of whatever Hitler and the Nazis stood for. World War Two had easy values and easy figureheads which were mythologized, and the idea of WWII as a myth was exacerbated especially by the Television and the new literature of the era. WWII penetrates our society today. and its values to a degree which is not present for any other war or revolution -- perhaps the American Revolution to some extent helps guide American culture, but WWII is the great uniter of culture at least across the West. The mythologization drove WWII into Good (us) vs. Bad (them), a concept which is pretty crazy historically. Hitler and the Nazis were obviously bad, and what would become the hippies heard this from their parents and from the media all the time. With their newfound individualism and all the attention on them, they decided that if Hitler was bad, then they would stand for whatever Hitler wasn't.</p><p>Yes, just the opposite of whatever Hitler believed in. Where Hitler pushed for nationalism and patriotism, the post-war literature of the day was pretty anti-patriotic, and firmly anti-nationalist. Where Hitler wanted to be a strong imperialist and colonial power like the rest of the West, the loud percentage of baby boomers wanted to end an unjust colonial occupation of foreign lands. Hitler came out of Germany, one of the premier instances of the Western culture then, and if Western culture and Western values could produce something so destructive and horrible, then something must be terribly wrong with Western culture, especially White Western that the Native Americans, Indians, or African-Americans did not feel. And so grew the International Style of Architecture (this was a philosophical idea much before the 1960s, but it really only took off so to speak in the 1960s), 'Modern Art', Existentialism and Postmodernism and more. White kids created a new sort of religion of not-Hitler, which is how such individualism and sexual liberty and freedom and anti-Christian and anti-Western values kept going on and on, adapting with characters and ideas from&nbsp;Bhaktivedanta Swami and such.&nbsp;</p><p>This revolutionary idea is echoing even now. Remnants of Hitlerian values are still being eliminated by left-leaning groups, especially ones in the revolutionary Youth Culture, which only became a thing in the 1950s. One can see this in the Christian religion, which has been picked on since the 1950s as something for the parents, something old, and something that limits. It is seen as something that is fake. While Christianity stayed incredibly popular up until the 1970s, it has died down in droves, cutting about 10% every decade. One can see how anti-Christian sentiment was en vogue among teens looking to irritate their parents, something that was not true pre-War, wherein there was no Youth Culture. There was Eminem and Marilyn Manson and the Satanic Panic and all this, and now Christianity is about 60% of the population. The same thing happens with conformity. Modern liberal values want to do away completely with the stuffy old conformity of the 1950s with suits and ties. They show more skin, and such, and as this continues, you have people who keep trying to subvert the population by doing something ever-stranger and ever-more unbelievable, and eventually you get to a situation that you saw in the last Grammys. Kim Kardashian went to the Grammys basically nude. This was incredibly subversive, and just about one of the last things she (or her producers or husband) could do to be popular and irritate the pearl-clutching Christians of America.</p><p>...</p><p>This being the case, that World War Two switched the values of Western Civilization so much and it is still going on today, then what would happen after World War Three? What would the values look like?</p><p>Well, the first important thing is to determine the values of each side, and to determine the values of each side, we must determine the alliances of each side. This is honestly pretty arbitrary, because it will probably be the individualist West versus the pretty conformist East (though that is changing with the spreading of the Nuclear family across the world, creating Individualism there. But for the sake of argument, I should like to say that it would be the Individualist versus the Conformist).</p><p>If the West wins this war, there would be hardly any change to society except perhaps a slight change in demographics with refugees, and perhaps a neo-Marshall plan of some sort. Nevertheless, the anti-Hitler values had won the war, and the society may continue as normal. But what if the Conformist East won the War?</p><p>Where Hitler pushed for nationalism and patriotism, the post-war literature of the day was pretty anti-patriotic, and firmly anti-nationalist.

I'll call this class of conservative revolutionaries 'yuppies', to be funny. I believe that where the hippies pushed for anti-patriotism and skepticism, the yuppies be jingoistic and nationalistic. Where the hippies wanted de-colonization (that is, no more obvious colonization ... we still see the white man's burden in, for example, USAID and financial influence in the CFA Franc) perhaps the yuppies would want a re-colonization?! perhaps extreme, but .... Where the modern Western values of individualism fell short, perhaps they need to be remedied by collectivism and conformity. The yuppies would look at the ugly, cut up cities of highways and brutalist and steel architecture and seek to replace it with a Western architecture, a walkable city. This is what the yuppies would do.</p><p>Of course, we don't need a war to bring about this social change. The right (not the far-right, mind you ... what an overused term) has obviously been gaining power in Germany with their AfD, America with Donald Trump, and much more. New Urbanism, which is really conservative as it seeks to bring back long-standing traditions of building, is beginning to take hold, especially in France, Poland, and some areas of America (it is popular among the youth). But of course, we will never know what will happen until we do.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/authors/dhruv-ravindra/" rel="author">Dhruv Ravindra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/the-south-bronx-and-dresden.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The South Bronx and Regulation</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
