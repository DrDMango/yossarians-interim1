Why, in America, was something like this tolerated? How is something so ornate and obviously something so well-loved and lived in falling to pieces like this?<br><br>Well, for many reasons. First, in 1960-1980 the poor areas of New York were hellish because of lazy landlords who did not up-keep their buildings allowing them to fall into disrepair.<br><br>The Housing Act of 1949 allowed the Government to condemn large swathes of cities across America and take them over, allowing developers to demolish them and build, leading to projects like 'Stuytown', Cabrini-Green, or the infamous Pruitt-Igoe. The Act was also used to run freeways through those areas, leading to instances such as the Cross-Bronx Expressway, which was key in segregating New York further. Residents were told to evacuate, and black neighborhoods were destroyed. This was looked at as a good thing by rich whites, who thought 'what a good thing we are doing for the poor people! We are rescuing them from the slums! (they were not slums)'.<br><br>Due to this landlord abandonment and Housing Act, old buildings like this from the 1800s fell into swift disrepair, creating a truly awful situation. A special example is the South Bronx. Search for 'South Bronx 1970' on your favorite search engine.<br><br>... One of the reasons this is one of my favorite images are the details and the history of the thing, that are now gone. There is the large, garish 'Kennedy Fried Chicken', which sounds very close to 'Kentucky Fried Chicken'. From its design, we can see this building was used until its end. A metal plate covers brick at the bottom. Some windows are covered, some aren't. It is uneven. The plates between the windows on the fourth floor, or second from the top, are asymmetrical. There are old ads scrawled across the thing: 'Century Pawnbrokers' at the top, 'Loans and Amount' on the second and fourth columns. There is a broken up sign advertising Dry Cleaning, a new service. Haha. There's an 'X' next to that sign, showing it being condemned. Its sign used to have electric lights. The cornice is broken. There are plants growing off of it. There used to be square pediments on the windows, probably all broken off -- you can tell by the cleaner portions that are left. The building used to have neighbors, since demolished. (You can tell by its friend to the side, the taller buildings in the back, the size of this building, and the way tall buildings like these were put up in the late 19th century New York -- all at once.) The trees at the back are pretty, but one feels they may take over the place it is such a wreck. The tenement is ornate and beautiful, it has been loved, and it is now going to die. I really, really like this image.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 19, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/authors/dhruv-ravindra/" rel="author">Dhruv Ravindra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/why-is-this-boston-tenement-so-lonely.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Why is this Boston tenement so lonely?</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/the-crowd-is-untruth.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The crowd is untruth</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://drdmango.github.io/yossarians-interim1/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
